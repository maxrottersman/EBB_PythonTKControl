# EBB_PythonTKControl
Sample app for controlling EiBotBoard (formerly EggBotBoard) using Python and TKinter GUI.  Used with my robotic DigiTiler.  More here: https://medium.com/@maxrottersman/large-format-digital-photography-through-my-digitiler-8a94a1099379?source=friends_link&sk=8ed4306c50161a250e730f2fd6463341

Info on board (http://www.schmalzhaus.com/EBB/)

I'm moving my control app to .NET because some image operations will be easier with it.  Putting this up in case anyone wants to use this marvelous board and wants some sort of sample code to start with in Python TKinter. Apologies if this mess offends ;)

Obviouly, feel free to contribute and fix it up.  I will probably come back to it at some point.
